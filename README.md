# Welcome!

### My Love for Digital Media

I have always been pationate about taking pictures and filming/editing videos. It has been like therapy
to me. I really like to watch [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat) on YouTube and he
has been a big inspiration to me, and what I do. Taking pictures and editing videos is very relaxing, and puts me
in a better mood altogether.

### **"Just Keep Breating"**

This is a quote I choose to live by, and has shaped who I am. 
It is by a band called: *We the Kings*! I listened to them growing up.
There song can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9vF6K5yUQc), go ahead and give it a listen.
It has inspired me since I was 12, and I am now 21. The lyrics relate to my life and how I have battled
mental illness over the last so many years!
